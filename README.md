### Hi there 👋

#### About:
- 🚇 My name is Suboptimal, and I'm just a typical Indian guy who used to work as a software engineer.
- 🌌 In late 2020, I quit my 6-figure tech job to pursue my dreams of becoming a YouTuber.
- 🤔 I keep track of my thoughts and learnings on GitHub, Twitter & my blog.

#### I post:
- 🐦 short-form updates (and dank memes) on [twitter.com/SuboptimalEng](https://twitter.com/SuboptimalEng)
- 💻 videos about web development & productivity on [youtube.com/SuboptimalEng](https://youtube.com/SuboptimalEng)
