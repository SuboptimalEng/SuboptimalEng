### Hi there 👋🏾
- 🤷🏾‍♂️ My name is Suboptimal¹, and I'm just a typical Indian software engineer.
- 💫 In late 2020, I quit my 6-figure tech job to pursue YouTube full-time.
- 🧠 I keep track of my thoughts and learnings on Twitter & my blog.

### I post 📝
- 🐦 Short-form updates (and dank memes) on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SuboptimalEng).
- 💻 Videos about web development and productivity on [youtube](https://youtube.com/SuboptimalEng).
- 📖 Rhoughts, learnings and struggles of being a tech YouTuber on [suboptimaleng.github.io](https://suboptimaleng.github.io).


¹ Not my real name, though I really wish it was.
