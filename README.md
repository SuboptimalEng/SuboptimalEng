### Hi there 👋🏾
- 🤷🏾‍♂️ My name is Suboptimal¹, and I'm just a typical Indian guy who used to work as a software engineer.
- 💫 In late 2020, I quit my 6-figure tech job to pursue YouTube full-time.
- 🧠 I keep track of my thoughts and learnings on Twitter & my blog.

### I post:
- 🐦 short-form updates (and dank memes) on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SuboptimalEng)
- 💻 videos about web development & productivity on [youtube](https://youtube.com/SuboptimalEng)
- 📖 thoughts, learnings and struggles of being a tech YouTuber on [suboptimaleng.github.io](https://suboptimaleng.github.io)


¹ not my real name, though I really wish it was
